# Materials modelling processing code

Code for preprocessing and postprocessing data from materials modelling simulations.
Here I will upload the different scripts that I develop for preprocessing or postprocessing the inputs and outputs of simulations that I generate for my research. Usually related to [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) or [Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/) simulations.

These codes are not intended for a general use or tool to help others researchers, but for me to have fast access to the codes. However, feel free to use them if you think that they could be useful for your research:)
