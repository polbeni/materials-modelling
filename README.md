# Materials modelling processing code

Code for preprocessing and postprocessing data from materials modelling simulations
Here I will upload the different scripts that I develop for preprocessing or postprocessing the inputs and outputs of simulations that I generate for my research. Usually related to [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) simulations.

These codes are not intended for a general use or tool to help others researchers, but for me to have fast access to the codes. However, feel free to use them if you think that they could be useful for your research:)

My idea is to develop a software that implements all these codes in a unique program more user friendly and could be used for many things in materials modelling field, trying to imitate the fantastic software for processing data from VASP simulations [VASPKIT](https://vaspkit.com/). For now, this does not exist yet.
